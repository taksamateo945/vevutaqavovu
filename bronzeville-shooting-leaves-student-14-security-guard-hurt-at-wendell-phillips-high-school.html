Bullets also went through the school door and struck a 14-year-old female student in her abdomen.</p><p>The student was rushed to Comer Children’s Hospital and was in critical condition. The male security guard was taken to University of Chicago Hospital, where he is in good condition.</p><p>Both had been stabilized as of early Wednesday morning.</p><p><b><a href=#>RELATED: Family of Michael Craig, Gresham man fatally shot by Chicago police, seeks body camera footage</a></b></p><p>Several parents, including the mother of the 14-year-old who was shot, were waiting to meet their children outside the school at the time.

She was shot twice,” the girl’s grandmother Joniece Cobb said. “She was inside the school on her way out to meet her mother when the shots rang out. They went through the door and they hit her. That door slowed them bullets down and saved my baby’s life. That’s the way I look at it.”</p><p>Students and parents made their way to school Wednesday morning, still in disbelief after that shooting.</p><p>As CTU and SEIU members along with local leaders prayed outside Phillips High School, some students and parents are still frustrated with what happened.</p><p>“A lot of tension and anxiety, nervousness, because we don’t know what the intent was — we don’t know if it was a student going after a staff member, a student going after another student, so it’s a lot of anxiety as a parent,” parent Dionne Eskridge said.</p><p>Some parents reluctantly dropped off their kids, feeling frustrated and scared.</p><p>“I feel like we just gotta do better. … We have to make sure they safe; without them feeling safe, we have a lot of kids that won’t want to come to school,” Shataqua Elmore said.</p><p>Some even decided to keep their kids at home.</p><p>“I am trying to get a safety transfer removal out of this school. I kept him home today, and I am considering keeping him home. I don’t know until how long,” parent Katarisha Cooper said.</p><p>Copyright © 2021 WLS-TV.
