When Nicole Walker’s (Arianne Zucker) baby was dropped off by Dimitri Von Leuschner (Peter Porte), Sloan wanted to deliver the baby to the hospital where it belonged.</p><h2>Days Of Our Lives Spoilers Highlights</h2><p>However, Melinda saw this as the answer to their prayers and convinced Sloan Petersen (Jessica Serfaty) to keep the child since her adoption just fell through. Will Melinda lay the blame on Sloan for the kidnapping?</p><h3>Melinda Trask Has Possession Of The Baby</h3><p>Days of Our Lives Spoilers reveal that Melinda took the baby home with her and even paid a doctor to say the baby had died. Nicole and EJ Dimera (Dan Feuerriegel) were then informed that their child had died from internal injuries from the car crash.</p><p>Meanwhile, Melinda is waiting to hand the baby over to Sloan and the very unsuspecting Eric Brady (Greg Vaughan).</p><p>Melinda having Nicole’s baby is not the only surprise here. Nicole believes that EJ is the father of her child. However, Sloan changed the DNA results to say that the baby belongs to EJ after finding out that Eric is the father.</p><p>Sloan’s actions will come in handy for Melinda to try to blame this on her. After all, Sloan stated the deception, this could have been her plan all along.</p><p><img alt="Days Of Our Lives: Sloan Petersen (Jessica Serfaty)" width=800 height=449 data-jpibfi-post-excerpt data-jpibfi-post-url=https://celebbabylaundry.com/2023/11/days-of-our-lives-spoilers-melinda-tries-to-save-herself-blame-sloan-for-stealing-baby/ data-jpibfi-post-title="Days Of Our Lives Spoilers: Melinda Tries To Save Herself, Blame Sloan For Stealing Baby" data-jpibfi-src sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DOOL-Sloan-Petersen.jpg></p><h3>DOOL Spoilers: Melinda Trask Knows She Could Go Down For This</h3><p><a href=#>Melinda has known all along that she could go down for her choices in this</a>. Melinda has known about Sloan changing those results for months. After Melinda was fired as DA, EJ took over.</p><p>This means Melina has stolen what the DA believes to be his child. EJ will see that Melinda rots in jail if possible if she is implicated in this.</p><p>Of course, EJ won’t go easy on Sloan either. Sloan led him to believe that he and Nicole were having a child together. EJ knows that Nicole probably wouldn’t have married him if she knew this baby was Eric’s. EJ doesn’t take kindly to people messing with his life or his family. Sloan has made a huge mistake now that he is the DA.</p><h3>Days Of Our Lives Spoilers: Melinda Trask Covers Her Tracks</h3><p>Sloan had given Melinda the money she used to pay off the doctor who declared Nicole’s baby dead. Sloan was the reason a traditional adoption wouldn’t go through.</p><p><a href=#>Melinda also told the doctor that Sloan needed him to do her a favor.</a> So far Melinda is doing everything as if Sloan was the person behind it. Melinda will continue to cover her tracks.</p><p>Of course, Melinda knows this will end Sloan’s marriage as well. Eric knowing how badly Nicole has been grieving for this baby will be the end of that and Sloan’s involvement with this child.</p><p>Eric already knows he married Sloan for the wrong reason but this will solidify that for sure. Will Melinda get away with framing Sloan for this whole baby mess or will both of them pay for everything they have done?</p><p>Be sure to catch up on everything happening with DOOL right now.
