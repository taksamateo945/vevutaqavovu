Following James Corden’s decision to do the same, this might signal the end of the late-night TV program era. The program is now gearing up for its twentieth anniversary, a momentous milestone for the namesake presenter and his colleagues.&nbsp;Let’s find out more about Kimmel’s contract and the show’s guest this week.</p><h2>Is Jimmy Kimmel stepping down from his late-night show?</h2><p>Jimmy Kimmel confesses to nearly shutting down his late-night talk show in a podcast interview on Variety’s Awards Circuit. He has previously advanced his television career by appearing on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire and presenting various award shows throughout the years.</p><p>He said, ”</p><p>“I have times when I think to myself, ‘I can’t do this anymore.’ And there are times when I wonder, ‘What am I going to do with my life if I can’t do this anymore?’ It’s a pretty tricky situation. There are also practical factors, family and friend considerations, and coworker considerations.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Jimmy-Kimmel-2.jpg alt="Jimmy Kimmel" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He went on to say:</p><p>“I’m going to have to quit doing this sometime. This is not something I intend to do indefinitely. I would be lying if I claimed I had made a decision one way or the other. But I’m thinking about it a lot.”</p><p>The announcement comes after CBS late-night presenter James Corden revealed that he would be leaving his own program at the end of the year. Kimmel is also expected to make a similar choice when his contract with ABC ends in 2023. According to People, ABC has yet to respond to Kimmel’s revelation.&nbsp;Kimmel has previously discussed abandoning his talk show ahead of his contract renewal in 2019. In a 2017 interview with Variety, he stated:</p><p>“I’m sure I’ll be doing the program for another three years. That might be the end of it. My wife is expecting. I’d want to have a bit more free time at some point. I already have very little spare time. I believe this work is a grind, and at best, a marathon. I’d want to leave on my own terms. If I ever feel like we’re repeating ourselves, I know it’s time to move on.”</p><h2 class=root-block-node data-changed=false data-paragraphid=6>The show’s guest is?</h2><p>Jimmy Kimmel, the late-night talk show presenter, persuaded and got US President Joe Biden to come in for an exclusive in-studio interview. This will be Biden’s first appearance as president on a late-night talk show.&nbsp;However, this will not be his first live performance; he already appeared as a virtual guest on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon in December. President Barack Obama initiated the tradition of presidents appearing on late-night TV shows in 2009.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Jimmy-Kimmel-3.jpg alt="Jimmy Kimmel" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The interview will run on ABC on Wednesday, June 8 at 11:35 p.m. PT/10:35 p.m. Central. It will be recorded in Los Angeles at 5 p.m. Kimmel made the news on ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel Live: NBA Finals Game Night during Game 2.&nbsp;On Wednesday, June 8, President Biden will appear on Jimmy Kimmel Live!
