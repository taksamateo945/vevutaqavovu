Her nationality is American, while her ethnicity is African-American. Amara is the youngest child of ace actor, comedian, and producer Martin Lawrence.</p><p>Martin Lawrence started as a comedian in places such as Washington D.C. and New York before landing roles on various TV shows and movies in the 90s. He later made a breakthrough after he scored his TV series, Martin, in the 90s.</p><p>Since that breakout role, Martin Lawrence has appeared in several blockbuster movies, usually of a comic persuasion. They include House Party, Do the Right Thing, Big Momma’s House, A Thin Line Between Love and Hate, and Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins. He, alongside Will Smith, is also the star of the multimillion-dollar film franchise known as Bad Boys. There have been three Bad Boy movies so far, and they have grossed a total of nearly a billion dollars.</p><h2><strong>Her Mother,&nbsp;</strong><strong>Shamicka Gibbs,&nbsp;</strong><strong>is a Chef, Entrepreneur, and TV Personality</strong></h2><p>Amara Trinity Lawrence’s mother is Martin Lawrence’s second wife – Shamicka Gibbs. Gibbs is a native of Los Angeles and was born on the 11th of November 1975. She reportedly has British and Scottish ancestry. Gibbs is a talented chef and once ran her meal delivery service known as <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Micka’s Pantry</a>, specializing in gluten-free and organic foods.</p><p>She is also an entrepreneur and owns about eleven outlets of the popular American massage and skincare franchise, Massage Envy. Shamicka Gibbs is also a TV personality and appeared on the talk show Bethenny&nbsp;in 2013. She was also one of the stars of the VH1 reality TV series, Hollywood Exes. Just as the name suggests, the series focuses on individuals previously married to Hollywood celebrities.</p><h3><strong>Amara Trinity Lawrence’s Parents Dated for a Total of 13 Years</strong></h3><p>Martin Lawrence and Shamicka Gibbs first got to know each other in 1997. They started dating that same year and soon enough moved in together. The couple dated for about three years before welcoming their first child together, a daughter named Iyanna Faith, in 2000. Two years later, they welcomed Amara Trinity.</p><p>Amara and her elder sister grew up with both parents for the next several years and lived enviable lives. Their father was a big name in Hollywood, and they had every type of material thing that they ever needed.</p><p>They also made their home in a gorgeous mansion located in Beverly Hills. The mansion featured <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>7 rooms</a>, 10 bathrooms, a built-in aquarium, a game room, a home theatre with a concession stand, and a sunken tennis court.</p><p>It was amidst this opulence that Amara Trinity Lawrence grew up. Her parents, however, made sure not to overindulge her and her sister. Her father famously grew up in a poor home and so made sure to teach his children that they won’t get everything they wanted on a platter of gold.</p><h3><strong>They Got Married in 2010 But Divorced in 2012</strong></h3><p>Amara Trinity Lawrence was about seven years old when her parents decided to wed. As you can imagine, it was a piece of happy news for her and her elder sister, and they eagerly agreed to serve as flower girls for the big day, which occurred on the 10th of July 2010. The<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external> ceremony</a> took place at their beautiful Beverly Hills mansion and featured 200 guests, including celebrities such as Eddie Murphy.</p><p>Seeing as her parents had tied the knot, Amara Lawrence Trinity most likely expected that the entire family would remain united forever, but that was not to be. Her parents separated just two years into their marriage and filed for divorce that same year. The couple did not disclose any reason for the divorce, but some <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>online blogs</a> accused Martin Lawrence’s sister, Rae Proctor, of abusing Shamicka.</p><h2><strong>Amara Trinity Lawrence Remains Close To Both Parents to Date</strong></h2><p>Whatever was the reason for her parent’s divorce, an 11-year-old Amara Trinity was saddened by the split. She, however, had no choice but to forge on with her life. Thankfully, her parents also eased things for her and her sister by pursuing the path of amicable parenting. They always turned up whenever she and her sister had events at school. She and her sister also got to accompany their dad to movie premieres and the likes.</p><p>As a result of this, Amara Lawrence remains quite close to both her mom and her dad, and they take any chance they get to tell her how much they love her. For instance, on the occasion of her 18th birthday in 2020, her dad shared a picture of her and captioned it, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>my baby girl is 18</a>. He also declared that he was proud of her. Amara’s mom was not left out. She equally shared her pictures and declared that she loved watching her grow into a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>creative</a>, joyful, and confident young woman.</p><h2><strong>She is a High School Graduate and Budding Singer</strong></h2><p>Amara Trinity Lawrence previously attended Westmark School, a private school located in Encino, California. She completed her diploma in June 2021, and her parents and sister attended the graduation ceremony.</p><p>Her mom shared pictures of the whole ceremony and declared that she and her ex-husband were proud of what their daughter had accomplished. Amara Trinity Lawrence is yet to start college, but in the meantime, she is exploring her passion for music.</p><p>The young lady who goes by the handle, ponyboiiimusic, on Instagram is blessed with some crazy vocals and taught herself how to play the guitar. She has dropped a few songs online, and it has led to an outpouring of supportive messages from fans. Her mom has also raved about her talent, stating that she is proud of her.</p><p>Despite using online mediums to promote her music, Amara Trinity Lawrence is not so active on social media. She has only about 17 posts on her Instagram since 2018. Her posts consist of just a few pictures of her and a happy father’s day post. She also talked about the killing of George Floyd in June 2020.</p><h2><strong>Amara Trinity Walker has Two Elder Sisters</strong></h2><p>Amara Trinity Lawrence has two siblings. They include her elder sister named Iyanna Faith. She also has an elder half-sister, Jasmine Page Lawrence, from her father’s first marriage.</p><h3><strong>Iyanna Faith Lawrence</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> 9th of November 2000</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 23 years old</li></ul><p>Amara Trinity Lawrence’s immediate elder sister is Iyanna Faith.
