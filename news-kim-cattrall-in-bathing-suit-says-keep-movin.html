She says that the time she grew up in, is one of the reasons she's in such great shape now. "This generation of women that I'm in, we have been brought up with Jane Fonda workout tapes and fresh air is good for you and exercise every day and drink eight cups of water," she says. "It's paid off at this time of my life.'</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/GettyImages-1400918861.jpg><p><span>Cattrall tells People that when it comes to wellness, she does it for herself, not to look attractive to a man. </span><span>"I don't do it for a guy. I do it for me. It's about taking care of yourself." "No matter your age, weight or athletic ability, aerobic activity is good for you. Aerobic activity has many health benefits. As your body adapts to regular aerobic exercise, you'll get stronger and fitter," says the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Mayo Clinic</a>. "Combined with a healthy diet, aerobic exercise helps you lose weight and keep it off."<br></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/GettyImages-1151685800.jpg><p><span>Cattrall revealed her favorite workouts to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Woman & Home Magazine</span></a><span>. She says that she chooses exercises that don't strain her body, since she's dealt with injuries before. "I've had injuries in the past, so I also do 'physio yoga' – a combination of physio and yoga so I'm constantly trying to rehabilitate my body. The older I get, the less jarring I want my exercise to be and I find that a long walk is equally as helpful and satisfying as a three-mile jog.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/GettyImages-1143938067.jpg><p><span>For Cattrall, wellness is all about balance. She revealed her approach to dieting and wellness to Woman & Home, saying, </span><span>I joke that I've been on a diet since 1974, which is basically true. I like to eat, and my body type is not naturally this thin – especially at this age. So I do watch what I eat and drink, but I'm not obsessive – it's just a way of life. So I don't have dessert after every meal – I just can't do it. I have a big appetite and I like to eat, and staying on top of that is about knowing myself and saying, 'I can eat that today, but tomorrow I'm not going to.' And I'm always aware from gaining and losing weight for parts, that the time in the gym trying to lose extra weight is really hard work! I always have that in my mind."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/GettyImages-1395618893.jpg><p><span>When it comes to skincare, Cattrall tells Woman & Home that she takes a quality over quantity approach. She says that she does things that help her skin, but doesn't have an intense routine. "I've got a very good dermatologist because I have very sensitive skin. I like to exfoliate and I wear make-up that has sun protection, but other than that it's a very lax regime. I wear a very minimal amount of make up in daily life because I like my skin to breathe."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkpKGdYrCiwNOrmKWkXZ67bq7ArZ%2BippdiwLa102aqmrGjYrimsc9mpKiumaN8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./plumb-crazy-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Plumb ___ (crazy)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./recipe-try-this-acorn-squash-fondue-from-food-network-star-melissa-d-arabian-52970.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Recipe: Try This Acorn Squash Fondue From Food Network Star Melissa dArabian!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./linda-cardellini-profile-ethnicity-husband-avengers-net-worth.html>Linda Cardellini Profile, Ethnicity, Husband, Avengers, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1307170-the-rise-and-fall-of-new-york-yankees-pitcher-joba-chamberlain.html>New York Yankees: The Rise and Fall of Joba Chamberlain | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and Rumor</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./beam-me-up-scotty-will-we-ever-teleport-or-travel-the-universe-and-live-on-mars.html>Beam me up, Scotty: Will we ever teleport or travel the universe (and live on Mars)?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./diego-barajas-medina-suicide-note-colorado-amusement-park-suspect.html>Diego Barajas Medina Suicide Note: Why Did Colorado Amusement Park Suspect Kill Himself?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-did-colleen-ballinger-do-drama-explained.html>What Did Colleen Ballinger Do?
