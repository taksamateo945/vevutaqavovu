the YouTube community as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Wode Maya</a> has displayed a touching act of kindness once again by donating $10,000 to cater for the educational expenses of 100 kids.</p><p class=align-left>He made this known in one of his videos on YouTube published on June 17, 2021.</p><p class=align-left>In the video, he narrated that he was first inspired by the story of an African-American woman who moved to Kumasi, Ghana to help put less-privileged kids in school, and after hearing that story, he decided to be a part of the change.</p><img

class=align-left>According to Maya, himself along with the assistance of his subscribers raised the <a href=# rel=noopener>money</a> for such a course by personally taking up the expenses of 10 kids with his subscribers taking up the rest.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Never miss breaking news – join Briefly News' Telegram

is very dear to his heart.</p><p class=align-left>He said he was once like them because growing up, there were times he had no uniform for school nor food to eat, adding that at a point, his school uniform had to be given to him by a friend.</p><h2><strong>Fulfilling his late father's dream</strong></h2><p class=align-left>He also added that giving back to society makes him feel he's fulfilling his late father's dream as his father took care of a lot of people when things got better for him.</p><p class=align-left>Wode Maya announced he will be taking on the expenses of 100 kids moving forward and encouraged his subscribers to help put 1000 kids in school as the next step.</p><p class=align-left>This donation was the second of its kind after donating a sum of $10,000 to a man in <a href=# rel=noopener>Kwahu</a> who transformed refuse damp into a beautiful park.</p><p class=align-left>Having been inspired by his story, he solicited funds from his over 800,000 YouTube subscribers to assist the man to develop the park further.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Having a big platform calls for more charitable acts</strong></h2><p class=align-left>Wode Maya admonished people with platforms to serve as instruments to encourage people to partake in building the African continent.</p><p class=align-left>He said he would have never shown this on camera, but that is his life now and he needs to show people that they can be charitable as well.</p><h2>Boity becomes most followed celeb in Mzansi, hits 5 million followers</h2><p class=align-left><a href=#>Boity</a> Thuli recently took to social
