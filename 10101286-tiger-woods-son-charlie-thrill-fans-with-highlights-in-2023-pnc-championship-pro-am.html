He made his official return to competitive golf a few weeks ago when he played in the Hero World Challenge, finishing 18th in a 20-player field.</p><p>While Woods was far from his dominant self, he made it through the tournament, and he seemed to enter the PNC Championship in a good place physically, as he walked the course Friday despite having the option of using a cart, per <a href=# rel=noopener>Bob Harig</a> of <i>Sports Illustrated</i>.</p><p>At one point during Friday's round, Tiger seemed to indicate that he felt good, as he decided to hit a driver from the fairway:</p>PGA TOUR <span class=acct>@PGATOUR</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Driver off the deck from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TigerWoods?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TigerWoods&lt;/a> ðŸ‘€ &lt;a href="https://t.co/ZGatwPAPMX">pic.twitter.com/ZGatwPAPMX&lt;/a></p><p>Charlie took a joking jab at his father when he chose a driver, but many observers on X, formerly known as Twitter, were impressed with the shot:</p>Mike Krumrei <span class=acct>@MikeKrumrei</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is such a dad flex.
